# seven_die

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
Here is what the app website is : 
Create a Flutter based web + iOS app that will do the following

1. Display a 5 sided die on the screen. But the with 7 random numers. So the die roll is a pool of 7 into a roll of 5.
2. Shared experience-- every user web or mobile sees the same die roll and the ui locks or all durning a roll.

Here is the web deployment : Web: https://sandbox.markhamenterprises.com/7-5die/#/ 

For mobile deployment you'll have to launch your own simulators and emulators locally.
